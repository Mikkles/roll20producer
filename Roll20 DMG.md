===========A NIGHT OF MASKS AND MONSTERS===================

## An original one-shot adventure designed for 3-6 level 3 characters.
The Roll20 version of a DMsGuild bestseller, downloaded more than 9,500 times and played by parties around the world. Newly redesigned and updated!

## Summary
In the city of Ibrido, locals enjoy a life of splendor and frivolity. Every week, a lavish party is held at the Castel di Maschera, hosted by the Marquis di Maschera, Prospero, who has a reputation for being a generous party-thrower and avid patron of the arts. Receiving an invitation to a Marquis di Maschera party is coveted, and those who enter his social circle never leave it.

But the Castel di Maschera holds many secrets. When a strange, hybrid creature — half bird, half man — is found brutally murdered in Ibrido’s city square, tattooed with the Marquis’s signature symbol of two masks, rumors have begun to spread throughout Ibrido that something more sinister may be occurring. 

Did a Marquis di Maschera party simply get out of hand, or does a real danger threaten the inhabitants of Ibrido?

================================== DEATH KNIGHT'S SQUIRE 

5e Solo Gamebooks presents The Death Knight’s Squire by Paul Bimler, a 100+ page solo adventure for D&D Fifth Edition, set in the Forgotten Realms. This adventure has been created for individual play without a dungeon master, and is is a great way to scratch your D&D itch between regular adventures with your DM. Or, it can serve as a way for a player who cannot find a group to get a taste of the game.

* “Definitely worth every dollar and more. The amount of work that has been put into this is incredible. You will most assuredly have fun adventuring ‘Solo Style’.”   Josh Lambert

“If, as I did, you cut your teeth on Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf gamebooks, you will definitely enjoy playing this solo D&D Adventure!”   David Bond

"Definitely a great substitute for group play."  Travis Dickens* 

The Death Knight’s Squire is the first in a planned series of solo, DM-less adventures. Unlike standard gamebooks, 5e Solo Gamebooks include a map / token dynamic to make the experience more like full tabletop gaming. Sections of the map are revealed as the PC moves through the adventure, encountering monsters, items and other occurences. The Roll20 version contains clickable links that move you between your choices, keeping you fully immersed. With over 350 separate narrative entries, as well as varied combat encounters, there are innumerable paths your quest could take! Another difference from standard gamebooks is that you roll up your own PC, just like in a normal D&D quest.

No need for a printer with the Roll20 version! Each entry is contained in cross-linked handouts, allowing you to navigate through the adventure fully immersed in the text! All maps have been fully set up in-game, and all creatures have been set up on click-to-roll character sheets to drag in whenever the adventure calls for it!

The Death Knight’s Squire has been extensively playtested by experienced players of 5e D&D, and includes combat, opportunities for spellcasting, use of diverse class feats / skills and more. The quest should take about 2-4 hours and is designed to be as close to the experience of playing with a DM as possible. (NOTE: It can also easily be played by two players, or run as a full party adventure with a DM and multiple players).

So read the introduction to the Adventure Booklet (do this first), roll up a new Level 2 PC (try using Roll20's D&D [Charactermancer](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360039644133-D-D-5e-Charactermancer)  to build your character in-game) and let’s get playing! And when you're done, be sure to check out the other books in the series, as listed below. The sequel to Death Knight's Squire is Tyrant of Zhentil Keep.

=============Baldurs Gate: The Fall of Elturel==============

## Baldur’s Gate: The Fall of Elturel is an introductory two-hour adventure for Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus or Tyranny of Dragons for 1st-level characters.

What appears as a normal mission to stop the Cult of the Dragon in the Elturgard Woods reveals a more sinister plot undertaken by the Cult of the Dead Three. This adventure seeks to invest the characters in the fall of Elturel by making its descent more personal.

Also included in this product are three new character backgrounds: the Hellriders, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Flaming Fist. These backgrounds include detailed information on each faction and ranks that allow characters to advance within each organization by earning renown. Additionally, this adventure includes two new magic items; a bone of animation (from M.T. Black’s *Mordenkainen’s Tome of Marvelous Magic*) and a rose of Bhaal. 

Whether you're running *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus* or *Tyranny of Dragons*, we hope you enjoy this adventure and that it motivates your players and their characters to save Elturel from utter destruction.

====================Danger in the Dwarven Valley=====================

## Nestled at the base of kelvin's cairn lies the Dwarven Valley, 

where the goodly dwarves of Icewind Dale have lived for centuries crafting fine weapons and armor. Looming on the eastern side of the valley lies the Halls of Black Ice, where an evil plagued the mind of many dwarves, culminating in a civil war. Recently, a new foe has found a home in these abandoned halls. With the help of some brave heroes, the dwarves may be able to reclaim these bountiful halls once more.

Little is written about the Dwarven Valley in *Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden*, though it was partially explored in Legacy of the Crystal Shard. This supplement to *Chapter 1: Ten Towns* and *Chapter 2: Icewind Dale* provides an expansion of the Dwarven Valley and includes:

* Expanded Dwarven Valley, including some NPCs, trade options, fungi, lore, and the Halls of Black Ice 
* Additional Adventure Hooks, providing the characters with reasons to explore the Dwarven Valley.
* A New Dungeon Battlemap, providing a harrowing battle in the tunnels of the Halls of Black Ice.

As always, it is up to you how much of the content you want to use. It's perfectly fine to use some parts of this supplement while discarding others, or simply let the ideas presented here inspire new ideas of your own. 

This supplement assumes a party of 4–6 characters of 3rd level. More powerful parties will have an easier time with the challenges within. Suggestions for scaling for 2nd level characters are presented within.
